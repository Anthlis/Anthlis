👨🏼‍💻 mobile & web, 📡electronics engineering, ✈️ flying a Piper Supercub, 🚲 cycling, 🌎 space and 🚀rockets, 🌩 storm chasing

This is my GitHub repository where I keep all my learning in API & web development and software for controlling hardware projects together for my interests above. As a qualified and experienced electrical and electronics engineer, I also enjoy making things using MicroPython flashed to PyBoards, WiPy, PyCom modules and ESP embedded devices. 

I am currently enjoying learning the Swift 5 language syntax and SwiftUI for iOS/MacOS app development. I am following Paul Hudson's @twostraws Hacking with SwiftUI curriculum.
