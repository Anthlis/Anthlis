This is my GitHub repository where I keep all my learning in software for iOS & MacOS Swift/SwiftUI development, API/web development plus automating repetitive actions in Python and code developed for controlling hardware projects together for my interests above. With a background as a qualified and experienced electrical and electronics engineer, I also enjoy making things using MicroPython flashed to PyBoards, R-Pi Pico, WiPy modules and ESP embedded devices. 

I am currently focussed and enjoying learning the Swift 6.x language syntax and SwiftUI for iOS/MacOS app development, and seeing how I can use Swift in place of Python nowadays.
