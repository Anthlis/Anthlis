My interests include: <br>
👨🏼‍💻Python & web, 📡electronics engineering, ✈️ flying a Piper Supercub, 🚲 cycling, 🌎 space and 🚀rockets, 🌩 storm chasing

This is my GitHub repository where I keep all my adventures in Python web stuff and software for controlling hardware projects together for my interests above. 
I'm a huge fan of [Talk Python Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/) courses, and completing [PyBites](https://codechalleng.es/) Code Challenges, so expect to see a few forked repos and work belonging to these endeavours.  

As a qualified and experienced electrical and electronics engineer, I also enjoy making things using MicroPython flashed to PyBoards, WiPy, PyCom modules and ESP embedded devices. 

__What I am learning/working on these days:__
   - Python, there's always more to learn!
   - PyBites Bites (working towards my next achievement belt)
   - Building awesome API's & web apps in Flask but more frequently using FastAPI now 
   - Blogging (about my ongoing Python projects, Code Club, MicroPython, etc)
   - Swift / SwiftUI
   
 __Achievements:__
   - TalkPython/PyBites #100daysofcode survivor, July 2019
   - PyBites Blue Ninja Belt (>250 points), January 2020
