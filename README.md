# hello there!

This is my GiHub repository where I keep all my advantures in Python, Flask and web design projects together. I'm an advocate of Talk Python Training courses, and completing PyBites Bites and Code Challenges, so expect to see a few forked repos and work belonging to these endeavours. As an educated electronics and electrical engineer, I also enjoy making things using MicroPython flashed to PyBoards, WiPy, PyCom modules and ESP embedded devices.
